A very rough initial attempt to build a subway route finder app. 

Objective: two people traveling from different locations in New York City are looking for the most convenience mutually accessible meeting place. 

Inelegant solution: find all possible routes for each person, subset the overlapping routes. Choose the most convenient combination of routes. 

Possible improvements: different architecture for data store; trim inefficient routes as the trees are growing.
